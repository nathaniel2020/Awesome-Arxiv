It also\nuses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes to assist\nscheduler decisions, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation\nprotocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling without a central admin.\nExtensive experiments show that Chaos consistently achieves much lower\nscale-out delays than Pollux, EDL, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in,\nconnect-link, and disconnect-link events within 1 millisecond, making it\nsmoother to handle node joins, exits, and failures.

However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:\n(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating\nand optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of\nmethods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal\nperception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary\nFramework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning\nboundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a\ncombination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable\nguidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in\nmultimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces\nunmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the\nreasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two\nsub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both\nunmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive\nexperiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our\nframework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,\noffer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,\nand expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning.

However, in this work, we show\nthat there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.\nAs language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,\nmodeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated\nfrom the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will\nmislead the eliciting of \"thoughts\" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of\nthe premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed\nLanguage-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap.

TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive\npractical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the\neffective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination\nof treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of\nclinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine\nlearning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective\nconstraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack\nspecialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model\nscale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and\nspecifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM\ncorpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and\nknowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and\nsystematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,\nwe establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in\nTCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and\nreal-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant\npotential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,\nbridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "published": "2025-05-19 14:17:37", "updated": "2025-05-19 14:17:37", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13156v1", "comment": "23 pages, 4 figures, and 1 tables", "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

In this work, we propose\nMultimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering\ngeneral-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of\ndirectly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process\nas a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model\nfirst conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses\nand eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not\nonly improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances\nthe performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored\nresponses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:\n1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate\nand prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)\nText-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline\nfor distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,\nwhich is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability\nvia warm up supervised fine-tuning.
