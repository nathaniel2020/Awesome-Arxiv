To address this gap, we\nintroduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation\nframework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across\n188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,\nCyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests\nfor vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding\nsource repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it\nrequires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant\ncode fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target\nvulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best\ncombination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%\nreproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing\nhistorical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can\nreveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest\nversions of the software projects.", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "published": "2025-06-03 07:35:14", "updated": "2025-06-03 07:35:14", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02548v1", "comment": null, "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

As a result, many methods may introduce more\nprediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive\ncontinuity and coherence.

In line\nwith this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the\nmost plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.\nExtensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art\nmethods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved\ngeneralization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B\neven surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7\nwith Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by\nincorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced\naction head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone\nfrozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous\nstate-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying\nVLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its\ngeneral-purpose strengths.", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "published": "2025-06-03 17:59:08", "updated": "2025-06-03 17:59:08", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03143v1", "comment": null, "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers.

For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle\nconditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions\ninclude: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site\nnavigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating\nform-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating\nform-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's\neffectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of\nweb application testing.", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "published": "2025-06-03 07:08:21", "updated": "2025-06-03 07:08:21", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02529v1", "comment": "Published in the Proceedings of JSAI 2025", "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

Importantly,\nOpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading\nspecialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench\nMultimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing\npreviously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,\n1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing\nstate-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target\ndomains.

In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser.

We propose a hybrid framework that integrates\n(1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to\nachieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a\nhuman-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract\nPolicy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline\ntrajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be\nused as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of\ntemporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it\nwill return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the\nsafety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude\nsatisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the\noffline dataset.

Although\nquantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social\ntheory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive\nmodels or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications\nof quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses\nthat gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines\nquantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of\nsocial norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,\nentanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a\ndynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These\nscenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving\nroles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment\nmonitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to\nsurveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions\nallow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent\npatterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with\ngenerative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and\ninterdependence in complex social systems.

This sequential dependency restricts the\nability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.\nExisting methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential\nspeedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an\nauxiliary \"drafter\" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases\nmemory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the\noutputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we\npropose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary\nmodels or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output\nconsistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be\ngenerated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly\nalter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively\ngenerating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode\nenables the next token's computation to begin immediately.

We achieve\ncapability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments\nor replacing them with \"Unsure from Here\" -- according to a tunable threshold\nthat allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean\ncorrectness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models\nfor biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three\ndifferent trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response\ncompleteness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response\nfragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1\nscore (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the\nrelevant baselines.

Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these\ninefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical\ndynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level\nheterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical\ndynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers\nnecessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a\ndynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource\nallocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to\nprioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and\nself-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a\ntwo-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that\nlearns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning\ndecisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore\nperformance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the\nperformance of the original dense model across benchmarks.

To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric.
