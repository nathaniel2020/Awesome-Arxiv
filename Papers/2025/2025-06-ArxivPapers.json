Thoroughly assessing their\ncybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in\nthis domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture\nreal-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we\nintroduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation\nframework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across\n188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,\nCyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests\nfor vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding\nsource repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it\nrequires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant\ncode fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target\nvulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best\ncombination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%\nreproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing\nhistorical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can\nreveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest\nversions of the software projects.", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "published": "2025-06-03 07:35:14", "updated": "2025-06-03 07:35:14", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02548v1", "comment": null, "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

This\nlimitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the\nstudent's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more\nprediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive\ncontinuity and coherence.

In this paper, we\npropose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its\ncore, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align\na dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the\nmodel to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line\nwith this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the\nmost plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.\nExtensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art\nmethods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved\ngeneralization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B\neven surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7\nwith Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by\nincorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced\naction head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone\nfrozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous\nstate-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying\nVLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its\ngeneral-purpose strengths.", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "published": "2025-06-03 17:59:08", "updated": "2025-06-03 17:59:08", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03143v1", "comment": null, "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers.

This paper presents an\nautomated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web\napplication testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the\nsystem employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and\ngenerate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle\nconditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions\ninclude: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site\nnavigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating\nform-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating\nform-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's\neffectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of\nweb application testing.", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "published": "2025-06-03 07:08:21", "updated": "2025-06-03 07:08:21", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02529v1", "comment": "Published in the Proceedings of JSAI 2025", "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}

In contrast, synthetic tasks often adopt the\nneedle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) format, wherein a lack of coherence between the\n\"needle\" and the \"haystack\" compromises their validity as proxies for realistic\napplications.

In this work, we ask the question: what is the\nminimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance\nacross a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist\nagent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution,\nweb search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly,\nOpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading\nspecialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench\nMultimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing\npreviously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,\n1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing\nstate-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target\ndomains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist\nagent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline\nfor future research.", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "published": "2025-06-03 15:50:55", "updated": "2025-06-03 15:50:55", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03011v1", "comment": null, "doi": null, "journal_ref": null}
